Instruction to Run Flask App

Run flask run from command prompt, the application will listen on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Note : This can be run using wsgi, where we can access the url through dns name instead of IP
To do this, configure wsgi app in apache2 ( /var/www/flask_app )

Call the app run in app.py
